Generate a simple yet visually appealing website that can be run locally. The website should include a homepage with a welcome message, an About page with some content, and a Contact page with a form. It should use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design should be clean and modern, using Tailwind CSS for styling. The homepage should have a navigation bar linking to all pages, and the Contact page should include a simple form with fields for Name, Email, and Message, along with a submit button. Ensure the site can be opened and run in a local browser without additional setup. Also provide url and steps to connect in browser. Update Readme file also.
